# ECS Blue/Green Deployment Architecture

## Overview

This project implements a production-grade, zero-downtime deployment pipeline on AWS ECS using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and continuous integration/deployment (GitHub Actions).

## Core Components

### 1. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
**Location**: `terraform/` directory
**Modules**: 
- **Network**: VPC, subnets, internet gateway, routing
- **ECR**: Container registry for Docker images  
- **Traffic**: Application Load Balancer with Blue/Green target groups
- **Cluster**: ECS cluster configuration
- **Compute**: Auto Scaling Group, Launch Template, EC2 instances
- **ECS Service**: Task definitions, service configuration
- **CodeDeploy**: Blue/Green deployment automation (prepared)

### 2. Containerized Application
**Location**: `app/` directory
- **Language**: Python 3.11
- **Server**: Simple HTTP server on port 8080
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health endpoint
- **Logging**: Integrated with CloudWatch

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
**Build Workflow**: `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- Builds Docker images on code changes
- Pushes to AWS ECR
- Creates deployment artifacts

**Deploy Workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Registers new ECS task definitions
- Deploys to Fargate for testing
- Validates application functionality

**Infrastructure Update**: `.github/workflows/infrastructure-update.yml`
- Handles zero-downtime infrastructure changes
- Monitors rolling updates
- Verifies continuous availability

## Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategy

### Blue/Green Application Deployments
1. **Blue Environment**: Currently serving production traffic
2. **Green Environment**: New version being deployed and tested
3. **Traffic Switch**: Load balancer gradually shifts traffic from Blue to Green
4. **Rollback Ready**: Can instantly revert if issues detected

### Zero-Downtime Infrastructure Updates
1. **Rolling Updates**: Auto Scaling Group replaces instances gradually
2. **Health Checks**: ELB ensures new instances are ready before receiving traffic  
3. **Capacity Buffer**: Maintains extra capacity during transitions
4. **Instance Refresh**: Coordinated replacement of EC2 instances

## Design Decisions & Rationale

### Why ECS on EC2 (vs Fargate)?
- **Cost Control**: More cost-effective for steady workloads
- **Customization**: Full control over underlying instances
- **Performance**: Direct access to instance resources
- **Blue/Green**: Better support for CodeDeploy Blue/Green deployments

### Why Terraform?
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Version controlled, repeatable, auditable
- **Modular Design**: Reusable components across environments
- **State Management**: Tracks resource dependencies and changes
- **Multi-Cloud**: Can extend to other cloud providers

### Why Auto Scaling Groups?
- **High Availability**: Distributes across multiple AZs
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically replaces failed instances
- **Rolling Updates**: Built-in zero-downtime update mechanisms
- **Cost Optimization**: Scales based on demand

### Why Application Load Balancer?
- **Layer 7 Routing**: Content-based routing capabilities
- **Health Checks**: Application-level health monitoring
- **Blue/Green Support**: Multiple target groups for deployments
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: Centralized certificate management

## Security Considerations

### Network Security
- **VPC Isolation**: Private network boundaries
- **Security Groups**: Firewall rules at instance level
- **Subnet Design**: Public subnets for load balancers, private for applications

### Identity & Access Management
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access for services
- **Instance Profiles**: Secure EC2 to AWS service communication  
- **Task Execution Roles**: ECS task permissions

### Container Security
- **Private ECR**: Secure container image storage
- **Image Scanning**: Vulnerability detection in images
- **Read-Only Root**: Container filesystem protection

## Monitoring & Observability

### CloudWatch Integration
- **Logs**: Centralized application and infrastructure logs
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, network, custom application metrics
- **Alarms**: Automated alerts for threshold breaches

### Health Checking
- **ELB Health Checks**: Load balancer level monitoring
- **ECS Health Checks**: Container health validation
- **Custom Health Endpoints**: Application-specific health status

## Scalability & Performance

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatic instance scaling based on metrics
- **ECS Service Scaling**: Container-level scaling independent of instances
- **Multi-AZ**: Geographic distribution for availability and performance

### Performance Optimization
- **Connection Draining**: Graceful request completion during updates
- **Resource Right-Sizing**: Optimized CPU/memory allocation
- **Caching**: Application-level and infrastructure caching

## Disaster Recovery

### High Availability
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Survives single availability zone failures
- **Auto Recovery**: Automatic replacement of failed components
- **Load Balancing**: Traffic distribution across healthy instances

### Backup & Recovery
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete environment recreation capability
- **Container Images**: Immutable, versioned application artifacts
- **Configuration Management**: Version-controlled settings and secrets

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Efficiency
- **Right-Sized Instances**: Matched to actual workload requirements
- **Spot Instances**: Could integrate for cost savings (future enhancement)
- **Auto Scaling**: Pay only for needed capacity

### Operational Efficiency  
- **Automation**: Reduced manual intervention and human error
- **Self-Service**: Developers can deploy without operations team
- **Standardization**: Consistent environments reduce troubleshooting

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Deployment Strategies
- **Canary Deployments**: Gradual rollout to subset of users
- **A/B Testing**: Traffic splitting for feature validation
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic failure isolation

### Enhanced Monitoring
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request flow across services
- **Custom Dashboards**: Business and technical metrics
- **Predictive Scaling**: ML-based capacity planning

### Security Hardening
- **WAF Integration**: Web application firewall
- **VPC Endpoints**: Private connectivity to AWS services
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store/Secrets Manager

This architecture provides a solid foundation for production workloads while maintaining flexibility for future growth and enhancement.
